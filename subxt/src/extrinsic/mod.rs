//! Create signed or unsigned extrinsics.
//!
//! This modules exposes the extrinsic's parameters and the ability to sign an extrinsic.
//!
//!
//! An extrinsic is submitted with an "signed extra" and "additional" parameters, which can be
//! different for each chain. The trait [ExtrinsicParams] is at the core of an extrinsic parameter.
//!
//!
//! The structure [BaseExtrinsicParams] is a base implementation of the trait which
//! configures most of the "signed extra" and "additional" parameters as needed for
//! Polkadot and Substrate nodes. Only the shape of the tip payments differs, leading to
//! [SubstrateExtrinsicParams] and [PolkadotExtrinsicParams] structs which pick an
//! appropriate shape for Substrate/Polkadot chains respectively.
//!
//! For this implementation:
//! - "signed extra" contains:
//!     - sp_runtime::Era: This is utilized to determine the longevity of a transaction.
//!     - nonce: Account index (aka nonce) that stores the number of previous transactions
//!         associated with a sender account. This is utilized to avoid replay attacks.
//!     - tip: A tip payment for including the transaction in the block.
//! - "additional" contains:
//!     - spec_version: The version of the runtime specification of the node.
//!     - transaction_version: The version of the extrinsic interface. This allows hardware
//!         wallets to know which transactions can be safely signed.
//!     - genesis_hash: The hash of the Genesis block.
//!     - mortality_checkpoint: The block hash after which the transaction becomes valid.
